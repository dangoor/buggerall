# buggerall #

This is a library for accessing Bugzilla data conveniently from JavaScript 
in the browser. It defaults to working with bugzilla.mozilla.org.

Maybe someday there will be more documentation here.

## Requirements ##

* [underscore](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/)
* [datejs](http://datejs.com/) (plus the time.js module from there)

This version also assumes $.getJSON is available (as it is in jQuery).

## License ##

buggerall is licensed under the MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license, just like Firefox.
